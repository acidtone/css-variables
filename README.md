# Experiments with CSS Variables
CSS Variables are a really cool way to control CSS. Some experiements and more complex projects:

## Experiments
- [Dynamic Grid](crosshairs): A 2x2 CSS Grid that follows the cursor using CSS Variables derived from mouse coordinates.
- [Blend Modes Controlled with Mouse](mouse-blendmode): Cycle through blend modes and colours using mouse position. Colour controlled with x-axis position, blend mode effect controlled with y-axis position.
- [Colour Themes](https://codepen.io/acidtone/pen/VNNWKp): A simple three colour palette controlled with a range slider and CSS Variables. Easter Egg: scroll down to the bottom of the CSS to activate CSS rotation using the same hue angle.
